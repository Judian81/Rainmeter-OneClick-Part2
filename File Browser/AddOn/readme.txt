there is not problem with deleting Temp and Temp Icons folder.
if you do not know were the problem is.

directory's are not saved outside the IconExtract.exe path.
it is not meant to be moved to another folder in case when it comes to rainmeter.
just use the right path in rainmeter.ini file and every thing will be just fine.

you do not have to delete the folder.png in the IconExtract folder,
or there will be a problem. what you can do is make your own icon that is called folder.png.
so you can customise every icon you want. the icons that exist are not overwritten.

also the icons that were created in Temp Icons folder are not overwritten.
so you can put your own icons in there if you want.

you have to download ffmpeg to make tumbnails for video, music and picture files.
when you are downloading ffmpeg you just need ffmpeg.exe. more you do not need.
when downloading a package. you have to need the ones there will be only exe files in the zip.
